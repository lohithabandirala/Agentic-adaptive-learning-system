---

## üöÄ Full System Run Checklist

### Before Running
- [ ] AI Service is running (Terminal 1)
- [ ] Camera is connected and free
- [ ] Good lighting conditions for face detection
- [ ] Face camera directly (not at angle)

### During Run
- [ ] Window opens showing camera feed
- [ ] Face rectangle appears (green box)
- [ ] Emotion labels appear on screen
- [ ] Countdown timer is visible
- [ ] Frame count increases

### After Run
- [ ] Emotion analysis summary displayed
- [ ] Questions are generated and shown
- [ ] Files are created:
  - [ ] `emotion_summary_*.json`
  - [ ] `integrated_output_*.json`

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Checklist

### If AI Service Won't Start
- [ ] Check if port 3000 is already in use
  - Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
- [ ] Verify `.env` file exists and has valid API key
- [ ] Check `npm install` completed without errors
- [ ] Try: `npm install` again

### If Camera Won't Open
- [ ] Close other apps using camera (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- [ ] Check Device Manager for camera status
- [ ] Try different camera index (change `0` to `1` in code)
- [ ] Restart computer if camera is stuck

### If Emotions Not Detected
- [ ] Ensure face is well-lit
- [ ] Face camera directly
- [ ] Remove glasses/masks if possible
- [ ] Get closer to camera
- [ ] Check for error messages in console

### If Questions Not Generated
- [ ] Verify AI service is running
- [ ] Check console for error messages
- [ ] Verify API key is valid
- [ ] Check internet connection
- [ ] Look for quota/billing issues on Google Cloud

### If Getting Import Errors
- [ ] Activate Python virtual environment (if using)
- [ ] Re-run: `pip install -r integrated_requirements.txt`
- [ ] Check Python version: `python --version`
- [ ] Try: `pip install --upgrade pip`

## üìä Expected Output Verification

### Console Output Should Include:
```
‚úÖ Starting 20-second emotion detection...
‚úÖ Emotion detection completed!
‚úÖ Emotion analysis summary (dominant emotion, stress level)
‚úÖ Sending request to AI service
‚úÖ Questions generated successfully!
‚úÖ Question details (difficulty, bloom level, etc.)
‚úÖ Files saved confirmation
```

### Files Should Be Created:
```
vibethon/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ emotion_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integrated_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

### JSON Structure Verification:
- [ ] `emotion_summary_*.json` contains:
  - [ ] `overall_dominant_emotion`
  - [ ] `stress_level` (1-5)
  - [ ] `dominant_emotion_percentages`
  - [ ] `detailed_timeline`

- [ ] `integrated_output_*.json` contains:
  - [ ] `emotionData` object
  - [ ] `questions` object with `success: true`
  - [ ] Array of question objects

---

## üéØ Performance Benchmarks

### Normal Performance:
- [ ] Emotion detection: ~20 seconds
- [ ] Frame processing: 100-200 frames total
- [ ] API request: 5-15 seconds
- [ ] Total workflow: 25-40 seconds
- [ ] Question count: Matches requested count (default 5)

### If Performance is Slow:
- [ ] Check internet speed
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Reduce video quality (lower FPS)
- [ ] Ensure computer meets minimum specs

---

## üì± Quick Test Commands

Copy and paste these to quickly verify:

```bash
# Test Python installation
python --version
python -c "import cv2, deepface, requests; print('All Python packages OK')"

# Test Node.js installation
node --version
npm --version

# Test AI Service (in ai service folder)
cd "ai service"
npm start

# Test Integration (in new terminal)
python test_integration.py

# Run Full System
python integrated_emotion_assessment.py
```

---

## ‚ú® Final Verification

Before presenting/demoing:
- [ ] Run complete workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify all output files are created
