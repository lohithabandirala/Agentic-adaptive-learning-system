# üéì Class Code System - Complete Guide

## Overview
The AI Learning Portal now includes a **class-based organization system** where teachers create classes with unique alphanumeric codes, and students join these classes to access tests.

---

## üîë Key Features

### For Teachers
1. **Create Classes** with unique 6-character codes (e.g., `ABC123`)
2. **Share class codes** with students
3. **Upload materials** and **generate tests** within specific classes
4. **View class roster** and test assignments
5. **Manage multiple classes** simultaneously

### For Students
1. **Join classes** using 6-character codes provided by teachers
2. **View enrolled classes** and switch between them
3. **Access tests** only from joined classes
4. **Take adaptive tests** scoped to specific classes

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### Teacher Workflow

#### Step 1: Create a Class
1. Login as Teacher
2. Click **"+ Create Class"** button
3. Enter class name (e.g., "Math 101 - Spring 2025")
4. Add optional description
5. Click **"Create"**
6. System generates unique code (e.g., `XY4P9Z`)

#### Step 2: Share Class Code
- Copy the 6-character code
- Share with students via email, LMS, or classroom announcement
- Students use this code to join

#### Step 3: Select Class & Generate Tests
1. Click on a class card to select it (highlighted in blue)
2. Upload course materials (PDF, DOC, images)
3. Click **"ü§ñ Generate Questions"** on a material
4. Test is automatically added to the selected class
5. Students in that class can now see and take the test

### Student Workflow

#### Step 1: Join a Class
1. Login as Student
2. Click **"+ Join Class"** button
3. Enter the 6-character code from your teacher
4. Click **"Join Class"**
5. You're now enrolled!

#### Step 2: Take Tests
1. Select a class from your enrolled classes (highlighted in green)
2. View available tests in that class
3. Click **"Start Test"** to begin
4. Complete the adaptive test with timed questions
5. View performance insights after completion

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Classes
```
POST   /api/classes/create           - Create new class
POST   /api/classes/join             - Join class with code
GET    /api/classes/teacher/:id      - Get teacher's classes
GET    /api/classes/student/:id      - Get student's classes
GET    /api/classes/:id              - Get class details
POST   /api/classes/:id/tests        - Add test to class
```

#### Tests (Enhanced)
```
POST   /api/tests/generate           - Generate test (now requires classId)
GET    /api/tests?classId=xxx        - Get tests filtered by class
```

### Data Structure

**Class Object:**
```typescript
{
  id: string;           // "class_1234567890"
  code: string;         // "ABC123" (6-char unique code)
  name: string;         // "Math 101"
  description: string;  // Optional description
  teacherId: string;    // Teacher who created it
  students: string[];   // Array of student IDs
  tests: string[];      // Array of test IDs
  createdAt: string;    // ISO timestamp
}
```

**Test Object (Updated):**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;         // NEW: Test name
  materialId: string;
  classId: string;      // NEW: Class association
  questions: Array<{
    id: string;
    text: string;
    difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  }>;
}
```

### Code Generation Algorithm
- Uses 6 characters from set: `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789`
- Excludes confusing characters: `0`, `O`, `1`, `I`
- Random generation ensures uniqueness
- Easy to read and share

  - Grid layout showing all classes
  - Each card displays:
    - Class name and description
    - Student count
    - 6-character code
    - Selection indicator (blue highlight)
  - "Create Class" button
- **Class selection** required before generating tests
- Selected class shown with blue border and "Selected" badge

### Student Portal
- **"My Classes" section** at the top
  - List showing enrolled classes
  - Each card displays:
    - Class name and description
    - Selection indicator (green highlight)
  - "Join Class" button with code input
- **Code input** accepts 6 uppercase characters
- **Tests filtered** by selected class
- Active class shown with green border and "Active" badge

## üéØ Example User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Teacher Creates Class & Assigns Test
```
1. Teacher logs in
2. Creates class "AP Physics - Period 3"
3. Gets code: "PHY3A2"
4. Shares code with students
5. Uploads "Chapter_5_Thermodynamics.pdf"
6. Selects "AP Physics - Period 3" class
7. Clicks "Generate Questions" on the uploaded material
8. Test created and assigned to class
```

### Scenario 2: Student Joins & Takes Test
```
1. Student logs in
2. Clicks "Join Class"
3. Enters code "PHY3A2"
4. Joins "AP Physics - Period 3"
5. Sees new test available
6. Clicks "Start Test"
7. Takes adaptive test
8. Views performance charts
```

### Scenario 3: Teacher Manages Multiple Classes
```
1. Teacher has 3 classes:
   - "Math 101" (code: M101XY)
   - "Math 102" (code: M102AB)
   - "Calculus I" (code: CALC1Z)
2. Selects "Math 101"
3. Generates test ‚Üí assigned to Math 101
4. Switches to "Calculus I"
5. Generates different test ‚Üí assigned to Calculus I
6. Students only see tests for their enrolled classes
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits

### Organization
- Clear separation between different courses/sections
- Easy to manage multiple teaching assignments
- Students see only relevant tests

### Privacy & Security
- Tests scoped to specific classes
- Students can't access tests from classes they haven't joined
- Simple access control via unique codes

### Scalability
- Supports unlimited classes per teacher
- Supports unlimited students per class
- Easy to add/remove students (via code sharing)

### User Experience
- Simple 6-character codes (easy to share)
- Visual class selection (color-coded)
- Clear indicators of active/selected class
- No complex permissions or roles needed

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Demo Mode)
- ‚úÖ Unique class codes prevent accidental joins
- ‚úÖ Students must know code to join
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No validation of teacher/student identity (uses dummy IDs)

### Production Recommendations
- [ ] Add real authentication (JWT tokens)
- [ ] Validate user roles before class creation
- [ ] Add class ownership verification
- [ ] Implement code expiry/regeneration
- [ ] Add student removal functionality
- [ ] Log class join events
- [ ] Add rate limiting on join attempts

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Database Migration
When moving to production database:
- Store `classes` table with indexed `code` field
- Store `student_classes` junction table for many-to-many
- Store `classId` foreign key in `tests` table
- Add indexes on frequently queried fields

### Performance Optimization
- Cache class lookups by code
- Lazy load tests when class is selected
- Paginate large student lists
- Debounce class selection changes

---

## üìä Analytics Opportunities

With class-scoped data, you can now track:
- **Per-class performance** metrics
- **Class comparison** reports
- **Student progress** within specific classes
- **Test difficulty** adjusted per class
- **Engagement rates** by class

---
