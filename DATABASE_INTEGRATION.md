# 🔧 Database Integration Complete!

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **1. Same Materials for All Teachers** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** All teachers were seeing the same uploaded materials.

**Solution:**
- Updated materials route to use MongoDB database
- Materials now filtered by `uploadedBy` (teacherId)
- Each teacher only sees their own uploaded materials
- Added authentication middleware to materials routes

### **2. Questions Not Generating** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** AI questions were not generating from topics.

**Solution:**
- Fixed Gemini API endpoint (was using wrong model path)
- Added proper error handling with detailed logs
- Tests route now uses MongoDB database
- Added authentication to ensure tests belong to correct teacher

### **3. Class Data Separation** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Problem:** Needed to track which teacher created each class and which students joined.

**Solution:**
- Classes now stored in MongoDB with:
  - `teacherId` - Which teacher created the class
  - `students[]` - Array of student IDs who joined
  - `classCode` - Unique alphanumeric code
  - `tests[]` - Array of test IDs for this class
- Teachers can only see their own classes
- Students see only classes they've joined

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Classes Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  name: "Biology 101",
  description: "Introduction to Biology",
  classCode: "ABC123",
  teacherId: "6712abc...", // Teacher who created it
  students: [
    "6712def...", // Student 1 ID
    "6712ghi...", // Student 2 ID
  ],
  tests: [
    "test_123...", // Test 1 ID
    "test_456...", // Test 2 ID
  ],
  createdAt: ISODate("2025-10-17T...")
}
```

### **Materials Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  id: "material_1729...",
  fileName: "biology_chapter1.pdf",
  filePath: "uploads/biology_chapter1.pdf",
  uploadedBy: "6712abc...", // Teacher ID
  classId: "6712xyz...", // Optional: link to class
  uploadedAt: ISODate("2025-10-17T...")
}
```

### **Tests Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  testId: "test_1729...",
  testName: "Photosynthesis Quiz",
  classId: "6712xyz...", // Which class this test belongs to
  createdBy: "6712abc...", // Teacher ID
  questions: [
    {
      id: "q1",
      text: "What is chlorophyll?",
      options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
      correctAnswer: "B",
      difficulty: "medium"
    }
  ],
  materialId: "material_123...", // Optional: source material
  createdAt: ISODate("2025-10-17T...")
}
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### **Teacher Creates Class:**
```javascript
POST /api/classes/create
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <teacher_token>" }
Body: { className: "Biology 101", description: "..." }

→ Server extracts teacherId from JWT token
→ Creates class in database with teacherId
→ Generates unique classCode (e.g., "ABC123")
→ Returns class info to teacher
```

### **Teacher Uploads Material:**
```javascript
POST /api/materials/upload
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <teacher_token>" }
Body: FormData with file

→ Server extracts teacherId from JWT token
→ Saves file to uploads/ folder
→ Creates material record with uploadedBy = teacherId
→ Only this teacher can see this material
```

### **Teacher Creates Test:**
```javascript
POST /api/tests/generate
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <teacher_token>" }
Body: { textInput: "...", numQuestions: 10, classId: "..." }

→ Server extracts teacherId from JWT token
→ Calls Gemini AI to generate questions
→ Saves test with createdBy = teacherId
→ Links test to class
→ Returns questions preview
```

### **Student Joins Class:**
```javascript
POST /api/classes/join
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <student_token>" }
Body: { classCode: "ABC123" }

→ Server extracts studentId from JWT token
→ Finds class by classCode
→ Adds studentId to class.students[] array
→ Student can now see this class and its tests
```

### **Student Takes Test:**
```javascript
POST /api/tests/start
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <student_token>" }
Body: { testId: "test_123..." }

→ Server extracts studentId from JWT token
→ Creates attempt record
→ Returns first question
→ Student submits answers with adaptive difficulty
```
