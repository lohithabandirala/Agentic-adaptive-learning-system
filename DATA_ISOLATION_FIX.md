# 🔧 Database Integration & Teacher Isolation Fix

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **Problem 1: All teachers seeing same materials**
**Root Cause:** Materials were not filtered by teacher

**Solution:**
- ✅ Updated materials route to filter by `uploadedBy` (teacherId)
- ✅ Teachers only see their own uploaded materials
- ✅ Admins see all materials

### **Problem 2: Classes not tracked properly**
**Root Cause:** Classes didn't properly track teacher ownership and student enrollment

**Solution:**
- ✅ Each class now stores `teacherId` (creator)
- ✅ Each class stores array of `students` (enrolled student IDs)
- ✅ Classes filtered by teacher when loading
- ✅ Student count tracked: `classEntry.students.length`

### **Problem 3: Questions not generating**
**Root Cause:** Missing authentication token in API requests

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added axios interceptor to include `Authorization` header
- ✅ Backend properly validates JWT tokens
- ✅ Question generation now works with auth

## 📊 Data Isolation by Role

### **Teachers:**
- **Classes:** See only classes they created
- **Materials:** See only materials they uploaded
- **Tests:** See only tests they created
- **Students:** See list of students enrolled in their classes

### **Students:**
- **Classes:** See only classes they joined
- **Tests:** See only tests from their enrolled classes
- **Materials:** No access to upload

### **Admins:**
- **Everything:** See all classes, materials, tests, users
- **Analytics:** System-wide statistics

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### **Class Model:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  name: "Biology 101",
  description: "Introduction to Biology",
  classCode: "ABC123", // Unique 6-char code
  teacherId: "user_id_here", // Teacher who created it
  students: ["student1_id", "student2_id"], // Enrolled students
  tests: ["test1_id", "test2_id"], // Tests in this class
  createdAt: ISODate("2025-10-17...")
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `teacherId` - Links to the teacher who created the class
- `students[]` - Array of student IDs who joined
- `tests[]` - Array of test IDs assigned to this class
- `classCode` - Unique code for students to join

### **Material Model:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  id: "mat_1234567890",
  fileName: "Chapter1.pdf",
  filePath: "1697567890-Chapter1.pdf",
  uploadedBy: "teacher_id_here", // Teacher who uploaded
  classId: "class_id_here", // Optional: specific class
  uploadedAt: ISODate("2025-10-17...")
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `uploadedBy` - Links to the teacher who uploaded it
- Used for filtering: teachers only see their materials

### **Test Model:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  testId: "test_1234567890",
  testName: "Photosynthesis Quiz",
  classId: "class_id_here",
  questions: [...], // Array of question objects
  createdBy: "teacher_id_here", // Teacher who created
  createdAt: ISODate("2025-10-17..."),
  materialId: "mat_123" // Optional: source material
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `createdBy` - Links to the teacher who created it
- `classId` - Links to the class it belongs to

## 🔐 Authentication Integration

### **Backend Changes:**

**1. Added Auth Middleware to Routes:**
```typescript
// Classes route
router.post('/create', authenticateToken, requireTeacher, ...);
router.post('/join', authenticateToken, requireStudent, ...);
router.get('/', authenticateToken, ...); // Auto-filters by role

// Materials route
router.post('/upload', authenticateToken, requireTeacher, ...);
router.get('/', authenticateToken, ...); // Auto-filters by teacher

// Tests route
router.post('/generate', authenticateToken, requireTeacher, ...);
router.get('/', authenticateToken, ...); // Auto-filters by teacher
```

**2. API Service Interceptor (Frontend):**
```typescript
// Automatically adds token to all requests
api.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

## 🎯 How Data Isolation Works

### **Scenario 1: Teacher A creates class**
```
1. Teacher A logs in → Gets JWT with userId: "teacher_a_id"
2. Creates "Biology 101" → Saved with teacherId: "teacher_a_id"
3. Gets class code: "ABC123"
4. Views classes → Only sees "Biology 101" (filter: teacherId = "teacher_a_id")
```

### **Scenario 2: Teacher B creates class**
```
1. Teacher B logs in → Gets JWT with userId: "teacher_b_id"
2. Creates "Chemistry 101" → Saved with teacherId: "teacher_b_id"
3. Gets class code: "XYZ789"
4. Views classes → Only sees "Chemistry 101" (filter: teacherId = "teacher_b_id")
```

### **Scenario 3: Student joins classes**
```
1. Student logs in → Gets JWT with userId: "student_1_id"
2. Enters code "ABC123" → Joins Biology 101
   - Biology 101.students.push("student_1_id")
3. Enters code "XYZ789" → Joins Chemistry 101
   - Chemistry 101.students.push("student_1_id")
4. Views classes → Sees both classes (filter: students contains "student_1_id")
```

### **Result:**
- ✅ Teacher A only sees Biology 101
- ✅ Teacher B only sees Chemistry 101
- ✅ Student sees both classes they joined
- ✅ Each class tracks its own students
- ✅ Each class tracks its student count
