## 🎯 Adaptation Logic

### How Questions Adapt:

**Scenario 1: Student is Calm**
```
Q1: Show medium question (Difficulty 3)
    → Student calm (Stress 2) while answering
    → ✅ Answer correct

Q2: Show harder question (Difficulty 4)
    → Student still calm (Stress 2)
    → ✅ Answer correct

Q3: Show challenging question (Difficulty 5)
```

**Scenario 2: Student Gets Stressed**
```
Q1: Show medium question (Difficulty 3)
    → Student stressed (Stress 4) while answering
    → ❌ Answer incorrect

Q2: Show easier question (Difficulty 2)
    → Student still stressed (Stress 5)
    → ❌ Answer incorrect

Q3: Show very easy question (Difficulty 1)
    → Student calms down (Stress 3)
    → ✅ Answer correct
```
