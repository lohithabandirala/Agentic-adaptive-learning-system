- **`run-integrated-system.bat`** - Run the integrated system

### ✅ Testing
- **`test_integration.py`** - Complete test suite
- Tests without webcam requirement
- Validates both low and high stress scenarios

### ✅ Documentation
- **`INTEGRATION_README.md`** - Comprehensive guide
- **`QUICKSTART.md`** - 5-minute quick start
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - System architecture & flow
- **`integrated_requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Emotion Detection
```python
# Analyzes 7 emotions:
- Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear
- Surprise, Disgust, Neutral
```

### 2. Intelligent Stress Calculation
```python
Stress Level 1-5 = f(negative_emotions, positive_emotions)
```

### 3. Adaptive Question Generation
```javascript
High Stress (4-5) → Easier questions, supportive tone
Low Stress (1-2)  → Challenging questions, engaging content
```

### 4. Complete Data Pipeline
```
Webcam → Emotion Detection → Stress Analysis → AI Service → Adaptive Questions
```

## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Version)

### One-Time Setup:
```bash
# Run setup script
setup-integrated-system.bat

# Or manually:
pip install -r integrated_requirements.txt
cd "ai service"
npm install
```

### Configure API Key:
Create `ai service\.env`:
```env
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_key_here
PORT=3000
```

### Run the System:
```bash
