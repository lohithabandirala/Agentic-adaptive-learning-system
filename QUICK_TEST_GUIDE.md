   Test Name: Photosynthesis Quiz
   
   Topic/Content:
   Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, 
   water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This occurs 
   in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically in the thylakoid 
   membranes where chlorophyll captures light energy. The process 
   has two stages: light-dependent reactions and light-independent 
   reactions (Calvin cycle).
   
   Number of Questions: 10
   Difficulty: Mixed (Adaptive)

## üéØ What to Look For

### ‚úÖ **SUCCESS Indicators:**
- Questions are relevant to photosynthesis
- Each question has 4 options
- Difficulty varies (not all same)
- Questions are educational and accurate
- No generic "Question 1", "Question 2" placeholders
- Timer works on student side
- Results show accurate graph

### ‚ùå **FAILURE Indicators:**
- Questions about random topics (math, history)
- Generic placeholders like "Question text here"
- Error alert appears
- Backend console shows errors
- Questions don't load
- Preview card doesn't appear

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **If you get "Failed to create test":**
1. Check backend console for error details
2. Verify API key in `backend/.env`
3. Try simpler topic: "Basic addition in mathematics"
4. Reduce to 5 questions
5. Check internet connection

### **If questions seem random:**
1. Check backend console logs
2. Verify prompt is being sent correctly
3. Try more specific topic text
4. Add more context in the topic field

### **If loading never finishes:**
1. Wait 60 seconds (sometimes API is slow)
2. Check backend console for errors
3. Restart backend: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` then `npm run dev`
4. Check Gemini API quota/limits

## üìù More Test Topics to Try

### Easy Topics:
- "Basic arithmetic: addition and subtraction of single-digit numbers"
- "Colors of the rainbow in order"
- "Days of the week and months of the year"

### Medium Topics:
- "Water cycle: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection"
- "Three branches of US government: Executive, Legislative, Judicial"
- "Basics of computer programming: variables, loops, functions"

### Hard Topics:

## üîÑ Testing Multiple Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multiple Tests in Same Class
1. Generate first test on "Photosynthesis"
2. Generate second test on "Cell Division"
3. Verify both appear in tests list
4. Verify student sees both tests

### Scenario 2: Different Difficulties
1. Generate test with "easy" difficulty
2. Generate test with "hard" difficulty
3. Compare question complexity

### Scenario 3: Different Question Counts
1. Generate 5 questions ‚Üí Should be quick
2. Generate 50 questions ‚Üí Should take longer
3. Verify all questions appear in preview

### Scenario 4: File Upload Generation
1. Upload a PDF file
2. Click "Generate Test" on uploaded material
3. Follow prompts
4. Verify questions match file content

---

## üìä Backend Console Should Show

When generation starts:
```
Calling Gemini API with prompt...
```

When response received:
```
Gemini response received: {...}
Parsing JSON response...
Successfully extracted X questions
```

If errors occur:
```
Error calling Gemini: [error details]
```
