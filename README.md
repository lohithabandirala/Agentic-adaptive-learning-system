## 🌟 What Is This?

An **intelligent assessment system** that:
- 📹 **Watches** your facial expressions via webcam
- 🧠 **Analyzes** your emotions and stress levels
- 🤖 **Generates** personalized questions adapted to your emotional state
- 📊 **Delivers** the perfect difficulty level for optimal learning

### The Innovation:
Instead of giving everyone the same questions, this system **adapts in real-time** based on your emotional state. Stressed? Get easier, confidence-building questions. Calm and focused? Get challenging problems!

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Detection
- Analyzes 7 emotions: happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral
- Uses OpenCV for face detection
- Powered by DeepFace for emotion analysis
- 20-second analysis period

### 2. 📈 Intelligent Stress Calculation
- 5-level stress scale (Very Low → Very High)
- Considers both negative and positive emotions
- Real-time calculation during video capture

### 3. 🤖 Adaptive Question Generation
- Powered by Google Gemini AI
- Adjusts difficulty based on stress level
- Follows Bloom's taxonomy
- Multiple question types (MCQ, Short Answer, etc.)

### 4. 📦 Complete Integration
- Single unified workflow
- Automatic data transfer between components
- JSON output for further analysis
- One-click setup and run

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites:
- ✅ Python 3.8+
- ✅ Node.js 16+
- ✅ Webcam
- ✅ Google Cloud API Key ([Get one here](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Installation:

**Option 1: Interactive Menu (Recommended for Windows)**
```bash
# Just run the menu!
MENU.bat
# Choose option 1 to setup, then option 4 to run
```

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
```bash
# 1. Run setup script
setup-integrated-system.bat

# 2. Configure API key
# Create "ai service\.env" with:
# GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Start AI service (Terminal 1)
start-ai-service.bat

# 4. Run integration (Terminal 2)

## 🎯 How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Student   │  Look at webcam for 20 seconds
│  (Webcam)   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Emotion Detection      │  Analyze facial expressions
│  (OpenCV + DeepFace)    │  Calculate stress level (1-5)
└──────┬──────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  AI Service             │  Generate personalized questions
│  (Google Gemini)        │  Adapt difficulty to emotional state
└──────┬──────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Adaptive Questions     │  Display & save results
│  (Personalized Output)  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Adaptation Examples:

**Scenario 1: Student is stressed (Fear/Sad dominant, Stress Level 4)**
```json
{
  "difficulty": 1,
  "questionText": "What is the basic definition of photosynthesis?",
  "bloomLevel": "Remember",
  "explanation": "Supportive and encouraging explanation..."
}
```

**Scenario 2: Student is calm and happy (Happy dominant, Stress Level 2)**
```json
{
  "difficulty": 4,
  "questionText": "Analyze how environmental factors affect photosynthesis rates...",
  "bloomLevel": "Analyze",
  "explanation": "Challenging explanation that builds on concepts..."
}
```

## 📊 Sample Output

### Emotion Analysis:
```json
{
  "overall_dominant_emotion": "happy",
  "stress_level": 2,
  "total_frames_analyzed": 150,

    "happy": 65.5,
    "neutral": 20.3,
    "surprise": 10.2,
    "sad": 2.0
  }
}
```

### Generated Questions:
```json
{
  "totalQuestions": 5,
  "questions": [
    {
      "questionId": "q1",
      "topic": "Photosynthesis",
      "difficulty": 2,
      "bloomLevel": "Understand",
      "type": "MCQ",
      "questionText": "What is the primary purpose of photosynthesis?",
      "options": ["Produce oxygen", "Produce glucose", "Absorb water", "Release CO2"],
      "correctAnswer": "Produce glucose",
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis primarily produces glucose..."
    }
  ]
}
```
