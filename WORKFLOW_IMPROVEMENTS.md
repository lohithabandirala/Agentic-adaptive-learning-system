## 📊 **What Gets Tracked**

### For Each Question:
```json
{
  "question_number": 1,
  "emotion_data_during_answer": {
    "overall_dominant_emotion": "happy",
    "stress_level": 2,
    "total_frames_analyzed": 45,
    "analysis_duration_seconds": 18.5,
    "dominant_emotion_percentages": {...},
    "average_emotion_scores": {...}
  },
  "question": {...},
  "student_answer": {...},
  "is_correct": true
}
```

## 🎮 **User Experience**

### What Student Sees:
1. Question appears on terminal ✅
2. Reads question ✅
3. Camera window opens (can ignore it) ✅
4. Types answer in terminal ✅
5. Emotion detected in background automatically ✅
6. Sees emotion summary after answering ✅
7. Gets immediate feedback ✅

### What Teacher/System Gets:
- Emotions captured WHILE student was actually working
- More accurate stress assessment
- Better adaptation for next question
- Complete timeline of emotional state during each question

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Background Thread:
- Emotion detection runs in separate thread
- Non-blocking - student can type answer immediately
- Automatically stops when answer submitted or time expires

### Thread Safety:
- Uses `threading.Lock()` for emotion data
- Global `stop_detection` flag to coordinate threads
- Daemon thread - won't prevent program exit

### Timing:
- Max 120 seconds per question (configurable)
- 1-second delay after camera starts (warm-up)
- 3-second break between questions

## 🚀 **How to Run**

Same as before:

```bash
python realtime_adaptive_assessment.py
```

But now:
- Questions appear FIRST ✅
- Camera starts AFTER ✅
- Emotions monitored WHILE answering ✅
- Much more natural flow! ✅

## 📈 **Benefits**

### For Students:
- Less intimidating (see question before camera)
- More natural workflow
- Can start thinking immediately
- Emotions captured during actual problem-solving

### For Assessment:
- More accurate emotional state
- Better adaptation logic
- Real stress during problem-solving (not before)
- More meaningful data
