## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install (One Command)
```bash
cd "approach with google adk\scripts"
install.bat
```

### 2. Configure
Edit `backend\.env`:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 3. Run
```bash
start-complete-system.bat
```

**That's it!** 🎉

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. True Adaptive Learning

**First Session:**
```
Student: "315" (New)
Topic: "Algebra"
AI: Generates baseline questions (difficulty 2-3)
Result: 60% accuracy, high stress (4/5)
```

**Second Session:**
```
Student: "315" (Returning)
Topic: "Algebra"
AI: Loads history, sees:
  - Struggled with word problems
  - High stress on complex questions
  - Good at basic concepts
AI: Generates easier questions, builds confidence
Result: 75% accuracy, reduced stress (3/5)
```

**Third Session:**
```
Student: "315" (Improving)
AI: Notices improvement, gradually increases difficulty
Focuses on weak areas from session 1
Result: 85% accuracy, low stress (2/5)
```

**AI learns from EVERY interaction!**

---

### 2. Emotion-Aware Adaptation

```python
Current Emotion: "fear" (high stress)
↓
AI Decision: "Generate simpler, confidence-building question"
↓
Question: Easier, supportive tone
↓
Student succeeds → Stress reduces
↓
Next Question: Slightly harder
```

**The system responds to emotional state in real-time!**

---

### 3. Comprehensive Data Tracking

Every session saves:
- ✅ All questions asked
- ✅ Student answers
- ✅ Correctness
- ✅ Time taken
- ✅ Emotions during answering
- ✅ Stress levels
- ✅ AI reasoning
- ✅ Feedback provided

**This data powers future personalization!**
