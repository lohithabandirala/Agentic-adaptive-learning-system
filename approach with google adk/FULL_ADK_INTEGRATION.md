- âœ… **Attempt** - Test attempts with results
- âœ… **EmotionTracking** - Webcam emotion data
- âœ… **Test** - Test configurations

#### Data Flow:
```
Webcam â†’ Python Service (port 5001) â†’ Frontend â†’ Backend API â†’ EmotionTracking DB
                                                                        â†“
                                                                  ADK Agent
                                                                  (queries DB)
                                                                        â†“
                                                            Personalized Questions
```

### 4. **Emotion Detection â†’ ADK Integration**

#### Flow:
1. **Frontend** (`EmotionTracker.tsx`):
   - Captures webcam images
   - Sends to Python emotion service (port 5001)
   - Receives emotion data (happy, sad, angry, fear, neutral, surprise, disgust)
   - Calculates stress level (0-1 scale)

2. **Backend** (`routes/emotions.ts`):
   - Stores emotion data in EmotionTracking collection
   - Links to studentId and attemptId

3. **ADK Agent** (`adkAgent.ts`):
   - **During Question Generation**: Queries emotion patterns via `query_emotion_patterns`
   - **During Session Analysis**: Receives current session emotions + queries historical patterns
   - **Decision Making**: 
     - High stress (>0.6) â†’ Reduce difficulty
     - Moderate stress (0.3-0.6) â†’ Maintain difficulty  
     - Low stress (<0.3) â†’ Can increase difficulty

### 5. **Question Generation with ADK**

#### Function: `generateQuestionsWithFullADK()`

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Agent receives request to generate N questions on topic X for student Y
2. Agent calls `query_student_performance(studentId)` 
   - Gets: Overall accuracy, recent scores, performance trend
3. Agent calls `query_emotion_patterns(studentId)`
   - Gets: Stress levels, dominant emotions, emotional stability
4. Agent calls `query_recent_attempts(studentId)`
   - Gets: Recent topics, difficulty levels, performance
5. Agent REASONS using all this data
6. Agent generates personalized questions that:
   - Match student's current skill level
   - Consider emotional state (easier if stressed)
   - Avoid exact repetition but reinforce concepts
   - Include varied difficulties (70% at level, 20% easier, 10% harder)

**Example Agent Reasoning:**
```
"Based on student data:
- Overall accuracy: 65% (struggling)
- Recent trend: Declining (-5%)
- Emotion: High stress (0.72), dominant: Fear
- Recent attempts: Failed 3 hard questions

Decision: Generate 5 EASY questions to rebuild confidence
Topics: Focus on basics they got wrong recently
Avoid: Complex multi-step problems
Goal: Reduce stress, improve accuracy"
```

### 6. **Session Analysis with ADK**

#### Function: `analyzeSessionWithFullADK()`

**Agent Workflow:**
1. Receives session results (answers, emotions, topic)
2. Calls `query_student_performance(studentId)`
   - Compares current session to historical performance
3. Calls `query_emotion_patterns(studentId, attemptId)`
   - Analyzes emotional journey during this specific session
4. Agent REASONS and provides:
   - Overall assessment
   - Strengths and weaknesses
   - Specific recommendations
   - Next difficulty level
   - Emotional insights

**Example Analysis:**
```
{
  "overallAssessment": "Good progress on basics, struggled with advanced concepts",
  "accuracy": 70,
  "strengths": ["Basic algebra", "Simple equations"],
  "weaknesses": ["Quadratic equations", "Word problems"],
  "recommendation": "Practice more word problems with step-by-step guidance",
  "nextDifficulty": "medium",
  "emotionalInsight": "Stress levels decreased after first 2 questions - confidence building"
}
```

### 7. **Backend API Endpoints**

#### Session-Based Endpoints:

**POST /api/tests/start-session**
- Student starts a test
- ADK Agent generates first batch of questions
- Uses `generateQuestionsWithFullADK()` with full data querying
- Returns: attemptId, sessionNumber, questions

**POST /api/tests/submit-session**
- Student submits batch of answers
- Saves results and emotion data
- ADK Agent analyzes session with `analyzeSessionWithFullADK()`
- If more sessions remain:
  - ADK generates next batch with updated difficulty
  - Uses previous session analysis + historical data
- Returns: sessionAnalysis, nextSession with questions

### 8. **Frontend Integration**

#### Student.tsx Component:
- Displays batch of questions (5 at a time)
- Collects answers for entire session
- Submits all answers together
- Shows AI analysis popup between sessions
- Shows blue banner with previous session recommendations

#### EmotionTracker.tsx Component:
- Captures webcam emotions during test
- Sends emotion snapshots to backend
- Emotion data flows to ADK Agent for analysis

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Full Integration

### What to Test:

1. **First Session (New Student)**
   - No historical data
   - Should start with medium difficulty
   - Should generate varied questions

2. **Second Session (After Good Performance)**
   - ADK should query performance from session 1
   - Should increase difficulty if accuracy > 80% and low stress
   - Questions should build on session 1 topics

3. **Session with High Stress**
   - Webcam detects fear/angry emotions
   - High stress level (>0.6)
   - ADK should reduce difficulty
   - Should generate confidence-building questions

4. **Session with Poor Performance**
   - Accuracy < 50%
   - ADK should reduce difficulty
   - Should revisit basics
   - Simpler question structure

5. **Session with Excellent Performance**
   - Accuracy > 85%
   - Low stress (<0.3)
   - ADK should increase difficulty
   - More complex questions

### Expected Agent Behavior:

**Iteration 1**: Agent calls `query_student_performance`
- Backend queries MongoDB Attempt collection
- Returns performance data

**Iteration 2**: Agent calls `query_emotion_patterns`
- Backend queries MongoDB EmotionTracking collection
- Returns emotion data

**Iteration 3**: Agent calls `query_recent_attempts`
- Backend queries MongoDB Attempt collection
- Returns recent attempts

**Iteration 4**: Agent generates questions
- Uses all queried data
- Returns personalized questions

## ðŸ“Š Verifying Integration

### Check Backend Logs:
Look for these messages:

```
ðŸ¤– FULL ADK AGENT: Generating 5 questions
ðŸ”§ Agent Tool Call: query_student_performance
ðŸ“¤ Tool Result Summary: âœ… Success
ðŸ”§ Agent Tool Call: query_emotion_patterns
ðŸ“¤ Tool Result Summary: âœ… Success
ðŸ”§ Agent Tool Call: query_recent_attempts
ðŸ“¤ Tool Result Summary: âœ… Success
âœ… Generated 5 personalized questions using 4 iterations
```

### Check MongoDB:
After taking a test, verify:

1. **attempts collection**:
   - Has attempt document with results
   - Has sessionAnalytics array

2. **emotiontrackings collection**:
   - Has emotion records for each question
   - Linked to attemptId and studentId

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

âœ… ADK Agent queries database before generating questions
âœ… Emotion data from webcam stored in MongoDB
âœ… ADK Agent uses emotion patterns in decision making
âœ… Questions are personalized based on performance + emotions
âœ… Session analysis uses historical data + current emotions
âœ… Difficulty adapts based on agent reasoning
âœ… Agent logs show function calling iterations

## ðŸš€ What's New vs Simple ADK
