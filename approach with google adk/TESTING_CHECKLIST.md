```javascript
{
  testName: "Math Session Test",
  topic: "Basic Algebra",
  numQuestions: 20,
  questionsPerSession: 5,  // ‚Üê NEW FIELD
  // ... other fields
}
```

      sessionNumber: 4,
      // ... Session 4 analytics
    }
  ],
  results: [                   // All 20 answers
    { questionId: "q1", isCorrect: true, stress: 3, ... },
    { questionId: "q2", isCorrect: false, stress: 6, ... },
    // ... 18 more
  ],

## üß™ PHASE 7: Advanced Testing

### Test 7.1: Test Difficulty Adaptation

**Create new test and intentionally fail:**

- [ ] Student starts test
- [ ] Session 1: Answer all 5 WRONG (0% accuracy)
- [ ] Submit session
- [ ] AI should say: "Struggling detected. Reducing difficulty" OR "Maintaining EASY"
- [ ] Session 2: Should be EASY questions
- [ ] Answer all 5 CORRECT (100% accuracy)
- [ ] Submit session
- [ ] AI should say: "Excellent! Increasing difficulty"
- [ ] Session 3: Should be MEDIUM questions

**Verify:**
- [ ] AI correctly reduces difficulty when struggling
- [ ] AI correctly increases difficulty when excelling
- [ ] Difficulty changes are logical

### Test 7.2: Test Edge Cases

**Test with different question counts:**
- [ ] Create test with 10 questions, 5 per session (2 sessions)
- [ ] Complete both sessions
- [ ] Verify 2 session analytics in database

- [ ] Create test with 15 questions, 5 per session (3 sessions)
- [ ] Complete all sessions
- [ ] Verify 3 session analytics

### Test 7.3: Test Emotion Integration

**Monitor emotion tracking:**
- [ ] Start test
- [ ] Make exaggerated facial expressions during Session 1:
  - Happy face ‚Üí Check if detected as "Happy"
  - Stressed face ‚Üí Check if stress level increases
  - Neutral face ‚Üí Check if detected as "Neutral"
- [ ] Submit session
- [ ] Check if AI analysis mentions emotion data
- [ ] Check backend logs for emotion stress values

---

## üìä PHASE 8: Performance Testing

### Test 8.1: API Response Times
**Measure response times:**
- [ ] Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- [ ] Start test
- [ ] Check: `POST /api/tests/start-session`
  - Time: Should be < 5 seconds
- [ ] Submit session
- [ ] Check: `POST /api/tests/submit-session`
  - Time: Should be < 3 seconds

### Test 8.2: Question Generation Quality
- [ ] Review generated questions
- [ ] Are questions relevant to topic?
- [ ] Are difficulty levels appropriate?
- [ ] Are options reasonable?
- [ ] Do questions make sense?

## üêõ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: Only 1 question shows

### Issue 2: Submit button always disabled
**Problem**: Not all questions answered
**Check**: Look for green borders on all 5 questions
**Fix**: Click option for each question

### Issue 3: No AI popup
**Problem**: Backend not returning sessionAnalysis
**Check**: Backend terminal for "AI ANALYSIS" logs
**Fix**: 
- Check Gemini API key in .env
- Check backend logs for errors

### Issue 4: Services don't start
**Problem**: Port already in use
**Fix**:
```bash
# Kill processes on ports
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
taskkill /F /IM python.exe
# Then restart
```

### Issue 5: MongoDB connection fails
